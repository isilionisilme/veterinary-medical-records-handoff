# Plan: Documentation Improvement — Wiki audit, restructure & standardization

> **Operational rules:** See [plan-execution-protocol.md](../../03-ops/plan-execution-protocol.md) for agent execution protocol, SCOPE BOUNDARY template, commit conventions, and handoff messages.

**Branch:** `docs/documentation-refactor`
**PR:** [#154](https://github.com/isilionisilme/veterinary-medical-records/pull/154)
**User Story:** [US-67](../implementation-plan.md)
**Prerequisite:** Iteration 12 merged to `main`.
**Worktree:** `8420/veterinary-medical-records`
**CI Mode:** Pipeline depth-1 gate (mode 2, default)
**Agents:** Planning agent + Execution agent
**Automation Mode:** Supervisado

---

## Agent Instructions

1. **En cuanto termines una tarea, márcala como completada en el plan** (checkbox `[x]` inmediato, sin esperar lote).
2. **Cuando llegues a una sugerencia de commit, lanza los tests L2** (`scripts/ci/test-L2.ps1`). Si no funcionan, repáralos. Cuando L2 esté verde, espera instrucciones del usuario.
3. **No hagas commit ni push sin aprobación** explícita del usuario.

## Objective

Audit, restructure, and standardize the project's canonical documentation to eliminate stale/duplicate content, apply consistent templates and navigation, and automate quality gates via CI.

## Context

The project's canonical documentation (`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/`, `docs/shared/`, `docs/README.md`) has grown organically across 12+ iterations. It needs an audit-first restructure to eliminate stale/duplicate content, establish a consistent taxonomy, normalize templates, and automate quality gates.

**Entry state:** Doc tooling installed (`markdownlint-cli2`, `markdown-link-check`, Prettier Markdown scope) via commit `a7c2c3d7`. No structural changes yet.

**Exit target:** Clean, navigable wiki with consistent templates, working TOCs, passing lint/link checks, and a CI docs-QA pipeline.

## Scope Boundary (strict)

- **In scope:** canonical human documentation (`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/`, `docs/shared/`, `docs/README.md`).
- **Out of scope:** assistant routing modules (execution instructions, not wiki content).
- **Exception:** Broken Link Checker and Terminology Enforcer may run across wiki + router when explicitly required.
- **Out of scope:** application code (`backend/`, `frontend/`).

## Commit recommendations (inline, non-blocking)

- After each completed execution phase (D5, D6, D7, D8), recommend a single narrative commit for the delivered delta with explicit scope + suggested message + expected validation (L1/L2/L3 as needed).
- In Supervisado mode, request explicit user confirmation before each commit.
- Push remains manual in all modes.
- PR creation/update is user-triggered only and requires prior commit-history review.

## Acceptance criteria

1. All canonical docs pass `markdownlint-cli2` with zero errors.
2. All canonical docs pass `markdown-link-check` with zero broken links.
3. All canonical docs have valid frontmatter per the approved schema.
4. Navigation (TOCs, sitemap, breadcrumbs) is complete and verified.
5. Key technical pages have been rewritten for readability with Mermaid diagrams.
6. Canonical glossary is defined and terminology is consistent across scope.
7. Onboarding guides exist for all four audiences.
8. CI pipeline runs docs QA on every PR touching `docs/`.
9. All templates are applied per Diátaxis classification.

## How to test

1. `npx markdownlint-cli2 "docs/**/*.md"` — zero errors.
2. `npx markdown-link-check docs/**/*.md --config .markdown-link-check.json` — zero broken links.
3. `node scripts/docs/validate-frontmatter.js` (or equivalent) — all files valid.
4. Manual review: navigate wiki from `docs/README.md` through all TOC links — no dead ends.
5. CI: push a docs-only change and verify the docs QA pipeline runs and passes.

## Execution Status — update on completion of each step

> **Rationale:** First know what we have (inventory + quality audit) →
> decide what stays and how it's organized (structure) → normalize format → polish style → automate.

**Legend:**
- 🔄 **auto-chain** — Execution agent executes; user reviews afterwards.
- 🚧 **hard-gate** — Planning agent; requires user decision.

> **Note:** 🔄/🚧 classify step *type* (auto-chain vs hard-gate). The protocol's ⏳/🚫/🔒 markers in §3 classify *execution state* at runtime.

**Key findings for downstream phases:**

1. **3 stale files** in `refactor/`: 12_FACTOR_AUDIT, CTO_REVIEW_VERDICT (broken link), codebase_audit — findings resolved in iterations 1-12
2. **Size concentration**: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN (15K), TECHNICAL_DESIGN (9.6K), PLAN_E2E_TEST_COVERAGE (7.5K) = 39% of all words → split/TOC candidates
3. **Completed plan format inconsistency**: `COMPLETED_ITER-N.md` (summaries, 169-517w) vs `COMPLETED_<date>_<slug>.md` (full plans, 2K-4Kw) — two naming conventions coexist
4. **Language mixing**: PLAN_E2E_TEST_COVERAGE and INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT are Spanish; Engineering Playbook mandates English
5. **EXECUTION_RULES.md** (5.2K) is agent protocol, not human wiki — may need reclassification
6. **12 completed files** total ~17.8K words — consider whether full plans or summaries should persist

### D1-B — Duplicate/stale findings

**4 stale** | **5 duplicate pairs** | **3 contradictions** | Collected 2026-02-28

#### Stale files (content-based; all committed within 90 days but content outdated)

| File | Severity | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| DESIGN_SYSTEM.md | **High** | 6+ color tokens diverge from actual CSS in `index.css`; active implementation contract |
| refactor/CTO_REVIEW_VERDICT.md | **High** | Metrics (411 tests→682, 7 CI→10), all gaps resolved; broken link `../production/` |
| refactor/codebase_audit.md | **High** | All 15 findings resolved in Iter 1-12; score table misleading |
| refactor/12_FACTOR_AUDIT.md | Medium | All 5 backlog items resolved |

#### Duplicate / near-duplicate pairs

| File A | File B | Score | Suggested action |
|---|---|---|---|
| BRAND_GUIDELINES.md | DESIGN_SYSTEM.md | 0.70 | **MERGE** — DS should reference BRAND for color values, keep DS-only tokens |
| DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md | IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md | 0.90 | **DEDUPLICATE** — remove cumulative table from HISTORY, keep in DELIVERY |
| CTO_REVIEW_VERDICT.md | codebase_audit.md | 0.85 | **ARCHIVE both** — historical artifacts, knowledge in completed files |
| COMPLETED_ITER-9.md | COMPLETED_2026-02-26_ITER-9-E2E.md | 0.85 | **CONSOLIDATE** — keep one canonical file per iteration |
| DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md | completed/* (collective) | 0.75 | **REVIEW** — acceptable rollup, no action now |

#### Contradictions

| Files | Topic | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| BRAND_GUIDELINES ↔ DESIGN_SYSTEM ↔ index.css | Color tokens (3-way divergence, 6+ tokens) | **High** |
| DELIVERY_SUMMARY ↔ ARCHITECTURE.md | CI job count (9+1 vs 10) | Low |
| CTO_REVIEW_VERDICT ↔ current state | Test counts, gap status | Medium (resolved by archiving) |

#### Recommended action priority

1. **UPDATE** DESIGN_SYSTEM.md — sync tokens to CSS (high-severity contradiction)
2. **UPDATE** CTO_REVIEW_VERDICT.md — fix broken link + archive banner
3. **ARCHIVE** codebase_audit.md — resolution banner + status column
4. **ARCHIVE** 12_FACTOR_AUDIT.md — resolution banner
5. **MERGE** BRAND↔DS color overlap — reference instead of restate
6. **DEDUPLICATE** IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY cumulative table
7. **CONSOLIDATE** COMPLETED_ITER-9 with full plan file

### D1-E — QA audit findings

**13 findings** — Critical: 2, High: 2, Medium: 6, Low: 3 | Collected 2026-02-28

| # | Sev | File | Finding | Suggested fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Crit** | ARCHITECTURE.md | `processing/` shown as top-level under `backend/app/`; actual: `application/processing/` | Nest under `application/` in tree |
| 2 | **Crit** | ARCHITECTURE.md | E2E metrics say "20 (8 spec files)" — actual: 64 tests, 21 specs | Update to `64 (21 spec files)` |
| 3 | **High** | ARCHITECTURE.md | `ports/` layer entirely missing from project tree | Add `ports/` entry |
| 4 | **High** | ARCHITECTURE.md | Tree says `infrastructure/` but folder is `infra/` | Rename in tree |
| 5 | **Med** | ARCHITECTURE.md | `domain/` described as "entities, protocols (DocumentRepository)" — protocols are in `ports/` | Fix description |
| 6 | **Med** | ARCHITECTURE.md | Hooks: "5 custom hooks" — actual: 8 hook files | Update count + list |
| 7 | **Med** | ARCHITECTURE.md | Frontend tree missing `api/`, `constants/`, `extraction/` dirs | Add 3 dirs |
| 8 | **Med** | ARCHITECTURE.md | `application/` description omits documents/, confidence_calibration, etc. | Expand description |
| 9 | **Med** | TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md | §14 says "5 hooks + 3 panel components" — hooks = 8 | Update to 8 |
| 10 | **Med** | DELIVERY_SUMMARY + TECHNICAL_DESIGN | "65 tests across 22 spec files" — actual: 64/21 | Update both |
| 11 | **Low** | DELIVERY_SUMMARY | CI count "9 (+ a11y audit)" vs "10" in ARCHITECTURE | Align convention |
| 12 | **Low** | DESIGN_SYSTEM.md | Primitives list missing Badge, Card, Dialog | Add 3 primitives |
| 13 | **Low** | DELIVERY_SUMMARY | Iter 11 references deleted `review-flow.spec.ts` | Note merged file |

**Verified correct:** DESIGN_SYSTEM tokens (post-D1-D), tech stack versions, backend test count (~396), frontend test count (287), all 4 ADRs, cross-references, language compliance, API route count, AppWorkspace LOC.

### D2-A — Approved taxonomy (v2 — user-approved 2026-03-01)

**Revision history:**
- v1 (2026-02-28): initial proposal with architecture/design/guides/ categories
- v2 (2026-03-01): user feedback — eliminated overlap between categories; adopted intent-based grouping (01-product/tech/ops/delivery/metrics); wiki promoted to multi-project platform

#### Current structure (problems)

| # | Problem | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | `project/` flat — 10 files with no grouping | Hard to navigate; evaluators waste time searching |
| 2 | `refactor/` legacy name — 3 of 4 files are stale/archived | Ambiguous: what is active vs historical? |
| 3 | `testing/` folder with 1 file | Structural noise |
| 4 | DELIVERY_SUMMARY, IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY scattered | Delivery evidence fragmented |
| 5 | No separation between human wiki and agent protocol | EXECUTION_RULES next to IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY |
| 6 | `project/` is singular — no room for multiple initiatives | Wiki can't grow beyond one project |
| 7 | v1 categories had overlap (architecture/guides both tech, guides/delivery/implementation all had plans) | Ambiguous placement |

#### Approved target structure (v2)

**New files:**
- `docs/README.md` — rewritten as multi-project wiki index
- `docs/projects/README.md` — initiative listing
- `veterinary-medical-records` (wiki generated by `scripts/sync_docs_to_wiki.py`) — project landing page with category table

**Folders deleted** (empty after migration): `project/` (entire tree)

#### Design principles

| Principle | Applied how |
|---|---|
| **Intent-based grouping** | Each folder answers exactly one question — no overlap |
| **Multi-project ready** | `projects/` allows adding initiatives without restructuring |
| **Minimal disruption** | Filenames preserved (ALL_CAPS), only paths change |
| **Explicit lifecycle** | `archive/` separates stale from active unambiguously |
| **Max depth = 4** | Deepest: `projects/veterinary-medical-records/04-delivery/plans/completed/` |

#### D2-B impact estimate

- ~50+ cross-references to update across all docs
- `docs/README.md` rewritten as multi-project wiki index
- 3 new README files (wiki root, projects listing, project landing)
- Git moves with `git mv` to preserve history
- `EXECUTION_RULES.md` references to plans and history must update
- `agent_router` references to `docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/` paths must update
